# Custom Achievements

Custom Achievements is a plugin server game for minecraft: java edition.

 **Please star and share the project! :)**

## Installation

**I recommend downloading the plugin from [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-achievements.95831/), because it's only the plugin `jar` file.**

But if you want, you can download the project.
The export it as a `.jar` file and paste it in your minecraft plugins folder. Make sure the server is running on 1.16.x version.

More information for how to install and use plugins you can find [here](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Installing_Plugins).

## Usage

Make sure to **`/reload`** the server, if it is running, so the plugin can be added.

  * To see the list with all achievements, you have to type `/listall`.
    * You can use `/listname player_name`, if you are **op**.
  * With the `/removeall` you can remove all achievements, that have been completed by you.
